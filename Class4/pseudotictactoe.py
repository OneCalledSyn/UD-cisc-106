#Make simple GUI to show game state
#Create an array with 9 null value indices to hold the game info
#Ask Player 1 for input to select a square to place an X
#Update value in array to 'X' and display an X on the GUI for their selected square
#Ask Player 2 for input to select a square to place an O
#Disallow players from overwriting array elements that arent null
#Update value in array to 'O' and display an O on the GUI for their selected square
#Starting on turn 5, being to check if a player has won the game
#Do so by comparing the array elements which if equal, indicate a win
#Eight possible winning combinations
#Continue play until someone wins
